Description
-----------

The ``mapHttpResponse`` directive is used as a building block for :ref:`Custom Directives` to transform a response that
was generated by the inner route. This directive transforms only complete responses. Use :ref:`-mapHttpResponsePart-`,
instead, to transform parts of chunked responses as well.

See :ref:`Response Transforming Directives` for similar directives.
